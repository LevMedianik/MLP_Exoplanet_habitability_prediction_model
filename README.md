# MLP_Exoplanet_habitability_prediction_model
This is Multi-Layer Perceptron model for exoplanet habitability prediction. The model is using NASA Exoplanet Archive dataset that includes more than 38000 planets and 66 variables reflecting planetary and stellar characteristics. The model can predict planet habitability with the accuracy of 99.67%.
